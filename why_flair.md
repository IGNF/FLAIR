title: Why FLAIR?

## Global context
<div style="background-color:#c1dced; padding: 1px; color: black">
Our planet can support life thanks to the numerous and complex interactions between the elements that make up the biosphere. Its internal dynamics converge to maintain <b>stable balances</b>, essential to the richness of life. These balances are destroyed by <b>human activities</b>, whether for primary needs - increase and pressure of the population through its vital needs - or secondary needs - improvement of services and quality of material and immaterial life.

Scientific studies and international organizations are constantly warning of this deterioration of bio and geo diversity: according to the latest FAO report on soil erosion, 75% of the Earth's surface is already degraded! One of the major and most visible causes of this degradation of ecosystems is the **artificialization of the soil**.

## European actions
<div style="background-color:#83768c; padding: 1px; color: black">
In order to promote <b>large-scale policies</b> to meet the challenges of ecological disruption, the European Union set up an Earth observation program in 1998: <b>the Copernicus program</b>. It aims to strengthen ground measurement tools with satellite sensors launched in 2014, including the star duo Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B. Their wide fields of coverage allow us to measure, understand and predict the <b>state of the environment</b> on land, at sea and in the atmosphere.

This program provides quality data from these sensors, as well as analysis tools, turnkey services and funding to disseminate Earth Observation techniques to member states and the international community. They thus contribute to the understanding of the **artificialization process**.

## European roadmap
<div style="background-color:#83768c; padding: 1px; color: black">
Convinced that providing sustainable growth to its citizens requires a major transformation of the economy and future policies, the European Union published in 2011 a roadmap to rethink <b>the use of resources</b>.

It aims to instill a **logic of sustainability** in markets and transform the economy so that it chooses the materials and resources needed for a project according to their environmental impact and manages the recycling of residual waste at the end of the project. It proposes actions to **preserve and restore ecosystems**, in particular through soil decontamination.

Its objectives, which may seem ambitious, are nevertheless necessary because at present, the contamination of soils and their poverty in organic matter concern many regions and threaten **European food autonomy**.

In fact, more than **1,000 km2 of land are artificialized every year** for housing, industry, road infrastructures or leisure activities. In sum, it is the equivalent of the surface of Cyprus that is tarred every ten years.

## French reaction action
<div style="background-color:#b3b3b3; padding: 1px; color: black">
Every year, 22,000 to 30,000 hectares are artificially developed in France (depending on the more or less restricted definitions of the concept), a rate four times higher than the demographic growth.

To begin the ecological transition, conservation measures, protection of delimited areas, and then ecological corridors have been introduced. From now on, it is a more ambitious objective to <b>fight against anthropic pressure</b> by limiting the consumption of space that is on the agenda of the French State according to the following definition of <b>artificialization</b>: "<b>transforming natural, agricultural or forest land</b> by development operations that may lead to <b>partial or total sealing</b>, in order to allocate them in particular to urban or transport functions (housing, activities, shops, infrastructure, public facilities, etc.).

This fight is expressed by the Climate and Resilience Law of 2021, which then sets the goal of **Zero Net Artificialization (ZAN)** of soils in 2050 following the actions defined within the **Biodiversity Plan** of 2018. Action 7 in particular of the Biodiversity Plan stipulates publishing: "**indicators of space consumption** and making transparent and comparable data available to territories and citizens at all territorial scales."

## What about IGN
<div style="background-color:#d5f072; padding: 1px; color: black">

The National Institute of Geographic and Forestry Information (IGN) is positioned as **a continuous observatory of the territory and its rapid changes**. It is in charge of producing the OCS GE (**OCS GE**), a large-scale land use and occupancy reference system, in order to meet the government's priority missions, and for this purpose it benefits from a Fund for the Transformation of Public Action.

This repository covers **the entire national territory** and will be disseminated in **open data** in order to allow each local authority to control the flow and **stock of artificialization** at its own scale in the context of the objective of Zero Net Artificialization. In order to increase the speed of production and updating, this database is produced semi-automatically using **deep neural networks**.

An intermediate product realized is the Land Cover by Artificial Intelligence, CosIA. It consists of prediction maps of land cover class membership of each pixel obtained from the output of deep neural network models.

## Scientific challenges
<div style="background-color:#ddf1ca; padding: 1px; color: black">

The training stage of deep learning models (learning by deep neural networks) is time-consuming because of the number of architectures to be tested and parameters to be set.

The IGN has therefore set up a series of challenges, called **FLAIR** for French Land-cover from Aerospace ImageRy, based on deep learning and the specificities of geographic data.

These challenges allow first of all to support scientific research by **providing the community with high value-added learning data** and codes to exploit them, with the aim of encouraging innovative approaches and exploiting the multimodality of the available data. It is also an opportunity for the institute to promote the general approach, to raise awareness of the work carried out and to federate a community around its problems.
</font></div>

## In brief
<div style="background-color:#ddf1ca; padding: 1px; color: black">

Faced with past and present environmental challenges, all levels of governance are trying to find solutions. These solutions must be based on fine and reactive territorial monitoring tools. This is the objective of the CosIA database, which seeks to monitor land artificialisation. To do this, it needs the collective intelligence that it brings together through the creation of FLAIR challenges.

You can therefore take part in this dynamic through your promotion, participation or general support.
